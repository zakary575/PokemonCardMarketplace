To run the application locally, you will need to run the commands `npm run install` in the root directory to sintall all the dependencies for the client and the server files, followed by `npm run start` to run node, or `npm run start` to initiate node on the server.

## Usage

Currently, you are able to create an account and log in to the website. Our hope is that in future development to add functionality to see order history, so that you can keep track of the cards you have already purchased.

To use the app, you do not need an account to search for Pokemon cards, simply enter the name of the Pokemon card you are interested in purchasing, and submit the search. The page will then display the results of the cards with that name, along with their prices. Once development is complete, you will be able to add the items to your cart to save them for future checkout. If you are not logged in to your account, then you will be prompted to sign in when you try to proceed to checkout.
